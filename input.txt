# This script is for testing the functionality of the entire game system,
# specifically the interaction between the application, processor, and I/O
# devices. Although this script is just for testing, we wanted to replicate
# a portion of the application we will need when programming the actual
# application: displaying the random numbers on the screen via the VGA.
#
# This script will display the random number generated from the LFSR on the VGA
# screen. It will then read some input from a button press, and flash the screen
# with the color of the controller that sent in the signal.

SETUP:

# Assuming Random number from LFSR is stored at memory address 0x008D
# Note about LFSR: The LFSR(random number generator register) is implemented in hardware
#            and will continuously generate a random number with every clock cycle.
#                This code is on git. Because this is continuous, in the actual application
#                     I plan to store the random value for the current round in a different adr
#                       in memory. This can be seen in the memory mapping in our documentation.

#stor R0, .lfsr;    #default random value = 0
